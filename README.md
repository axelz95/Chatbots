# Rasa Chatbot System
This repository contains two chatbot systems developed with the open-source framework Rasa. Because of the repository's capacity only the .yml files are provided however, with these files, it is possible to replicate the chatbots if you train your model on your local machine. 

The purpose of these chatbots is to answer PDT-related questions. One chatbot has anthropomorphic features and the other one has computer-like but competent features.
